# Attachment Visualizer (React + TypeScript)

Spacious, white/blue UI with navbar, charts, and D3 scatter to explore Attachment Project results over time.

## Features
- Dashboard: overview cards and line chart for General Anxiety/Avoidance
- Scatter: Cartesian plane Anxiety (X) vs Avoidance (Y), per-category arrows from previous to next; filter categories
- Tables: large, readable overview table; compact modes can be added
- Settings: export/import JSON, reset data
- Local persistence (localStorage); prefilled with your three entries

## Dev scripts
- `npm run dev` – start dev server
- `npm run build` – build for production
- `npm run preview` – preview production build

## Getting started
1. Open terminal in `zUtility/AttachmentVisualizer`
2. Install deps: `npm install`
3. Run: `npm run dev` and open the URL shown

If you prefer double-clicking a single file, use your existing `AttachmentTracker.html`. This app is a fuller project with routing and richer visuals.
